TODO:

- FTPStore and FTPFile - Finish classes
- Update all method comments
- Arr class
    - insert($array, 'New Element', $position)
    - delete($array, 'people.alex')
    - sum($array['people'], 'age')
- Crons
    - Cron script to configure and run things like App:rc() and any other automated tasks
    - Cron.php should just have an array of crons to run, with the path and repetition
    - Store last ran info for each cron in the config_table
- CLI - Redo the CLI or use an existing php library, as its not very good
- Error logging - Exception handling, logging to files, etc...



IDEAS:

- Different environments, e.g. create different directories of config file for the app, and then define the environment in apache, so it can load different config on diff systems
- Models - ORM





REMINDERS:

Caching
-----

Put in a controller to cache an action, with a lifetime and type, e.g.
Default type of dynamic will be used if not specified. If life is specified as 0, will use Renderer default

protected $cache = array('main' => array(
                        'life' => 10,
                        'type' => \DF\Renderer::CACHE_STATIC
                    ));

If a cache is found, it will render that and exit, so it won't even go into the controller action and do anything
DYNAMIC caching is what should be used in 99% of cases, as it will render the php script, so the php in the view is still executed, e.g. display *your* name from session
STATIC caching will cache a static version of the compiled page and display the exact same page to whoever visits that page, so should only be used in rare cases
